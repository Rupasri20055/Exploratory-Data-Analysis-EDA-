# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

About this Task: Hey! This task was all about exploring the Ames Housing dataset and trying to understand it better using some stats and visuals.

What I did in this task:

1. Imported the Ames Housing dataset using Pandas.

2. Checked the number of rows, columns, and data types.

3. Got summary statistics like mean, median, std, etc.

4. Created histograms and boxplots for numeric columns like SalePrice, GrLivArea, etc.

5. Plotted a correlation heatmap to see which features affect SalePrice the most.

6. Used a pairplot to visualize how top features are related to each other.

7. Noticed patterns — like bigger houses with higher GrLivArea usually cost more.

8. Spotted outliers in SalePrice and GrLivArea.

9. Made a few casual observations from the graphs.

Dataset:
- **AmesHousing.csv** — dataset I used for EDA.
