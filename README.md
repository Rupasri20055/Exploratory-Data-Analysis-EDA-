# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

About this Task: Hey! This task was all about exploring the Ames Housing dataset and trying to understand it better using some stats and visuals.

What I did in this task:

1 Imported the Ames Housing dataset using Pandas.

2️ Checked the number of rows, columns, and data types.

3️ Got summary statistics like mean, median, std, min, max etc.

4️ Created histograms and boxplots for numeric columns like SalePrice, Gr Liv Area, etc.

5️ Plotted a correlation heatmap to see which features affect SalePrice the most.

6️ Used a pairplot to visualize how top correlated features are related to each other.

7️ Noticed patterns — like bigger houses with higher Gr Liv Area usually cost more.

8️ Spotted outliers in SalePrice and Gr Liv Area.

9️ Added extra visuals like scatterplots, distribution plots, countplots, and a violin plot to explore the data better.

10️ Made a few casual observations from the graphs and trends.
